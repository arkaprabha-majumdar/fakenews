###Project - Create a classifier to separate fake news from real news

Google Initiative seminar by the Dept. Of Cultural & Media Studies,CURAJ on the 18th of January,2019 has inspired us 
to take up this topic and try to get rid of the extensive fake news problem in today’s media.

Why we need the fake news detection technology?
Fake news spread lies ,more readers shrug at the truth.
1.This area is now also a research area , many research papers were published
2.Google is taking initiative by funding 1000 ,1500$ to research groups
3.People have an idea of fake news but often times real news can be mistakenly considered a fake
4.Now we will look at the  machine learning model and how to implement a solution to rectify the problem.

THE DATASET::
1327 rows × 17 columns
We have got a dataset of 1300 tweets which were tagged as fake 
and we used 60% of our data  to train our  model and the rest 40% 
to test the result to reach upto required accuracy.

Implementation and technology used ::
Detecting fake news is not an easy task since there can be many definition of fake news . 
But there is some extent to which it can be possible using some machine learning models.
We can also use a lot of NLP(natural language processing) technology to make the computer 
understand the news as there is a lot of text involved.
The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs 
for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python 
programming language.

Results::
Finally at the end of our project ,we are estimating the likelihood of our results to 
be about 90% accurate  to detect the news if it was a real one or fake one
